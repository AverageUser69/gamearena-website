                                Corporation, a corporation under the laws of the

                                You become a subscriber of Game Arena ("Subscriber")
                                by completing the registration of a Game Arena user
                                account. This Agreement takes effect as soon
                                as you indicate your acceptance of these terms.
                                You may not become a subscriber if you are under
                                the age of 13. Game Arena is not intended for children

                                time of the transaction (such as in the case of purchases from
                                another Subscriber in a Subscription Marketplace), any transactions
                                for Subscriptions (as defined below) you make on Game Arena are being
                                made from Valve.

                                When you complete Game Arena’s registration process, you create a Game Arena account
                                ("Account").
                                Your Account may also include billing information you provide to Valve for transactions
                                concerning Subscriptions, Content and Services and the purchase of any physical goods
                                through Game Arena (“Hardware”). You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to
                                use
                                your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve. You are
                                responsible for the confidentiality of your login and password and for the security of
                                your computer system. Valve is not responsible for the use of your password and Account
                                or for all of the communication and activity on Game Arena that results from use of your
                                login name and password by you, or by any person to whom you may have intentionally or
                                by negligence disclosed your login and/or password in violation of this confidentiality
                                provision. Unless it results from Valve’s negligence or fault, Valve is not responsible
                                for the use of your Account by a person who fraudulently used your login and password
                                without your permission. If you believe that the confidentiality of your login and/or
                                password may have been compromised, you must notify Valve via the support form
                                ( <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> ) without any delay.

                                billing information, Account history and Subscriptions, etc.), is strictly personal. You
                                may therefore not sell or charge others for the right to use your Account, or otherwise
                                transfer your Account, nor may you sell, charge others for the right to use, or transfer
                                any Subscriptions other than if and as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including
                                any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use) or as otherwise specifically permitted by Valve.

                                Subscriptions, Content and Services and/or Hardware (the “Product(s)”) in exchange for

                                When you place an order on Game Arena, we will send you a message confirming receipt of
                                your
                                order and containing the details of your order (the “Order Confirmation”). The Order
                                Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order and does not confirm
                                acceptance of your offer to enter into an agreement.

                                In the case of Content and Services, we accept your offer, and conclude the agreement
                                with you, by confirming the transaction and making the Content and Services available to
                                you or, in the case of pre-orders, only by confirming the transaction to you and
                                deducting the applicable price from your payment method.

                                In the case of Hardware, we only accept your offer, and conclude the transaction for an
                                item ordered by you, when we dispatch the Hardware to you and send e-mail confirming to
                                you that we've dispatched the product to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation"). If your
                                order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch
                                Confirmation for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation and corresponding dispatch
                                will conclude a separate contract of sale between us for the Hardware specified in that
                                Dispatch Confirmation. Any Hardware delivered to you remains property of Valve until
                                payment has been fully made.

                                Payment processing related to Content and Services and/or Hardware purchased on Game
                                Arena is
                                performed by either Valve Corporation directly or by Valve’s fully owned subsidiary
                                Valve GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation depending on the type of payment method used.
                                If your card was issued outside the United States, your payment may be processed via a
                                European acquirer by Valve GmbH on behalf of Valve Corporation. For any other type of
                                purchases, payment will be collected by Valve Corporation directly. In any case,
                                delivery of Content and Services as well as Hardware is performed by Valve Corporation.

                                Game Arena and your Subscription(s) require the download and installation of Content and
                                Services onto your computer. Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a non-exclusive
                                license and right, to use the Content and Services for your personal, non-commercial use
                                (except where commercial use is expressly allowed herein or in the applicable
                                Subscription Terms). This license ends upon termination of (a) this Agreement or (b) a
                                Subscription that includes the license. The Content and Services are licensed, not sold.
                                Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of
                                the Content and Services, you must have a Game Arena Account and you may be required to
                                be
                                running the Game Arena client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.

                                For reasons that include, without limitation, system security, stability, and
                                multiplayer interoperability, Valve may need to automatically update, pre-load, create
                                new versions of or otherwise enhance the Content and Services and accordingly, the
                                system requirements to use the Content and Services may change over time. You consent to
                                such automatic updating. You understand that this Agreement (including
                                applicable Subscription Terms) does not entitle you to future updates (unless to the
                                extent required by applicable law), new versions or other enhancements of the Content
                                and Services associated with a particular Subscription, although Valve may choose to
                                provide such updates, etc. in its sole discretion.
